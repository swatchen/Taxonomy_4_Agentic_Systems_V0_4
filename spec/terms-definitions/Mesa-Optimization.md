[[def: Mesa-Optimization]]

~A failure mode in which a learning system develops internal objectives (“mesa-objectives”) that diverge from the designer’s intended goals, often incentivized by persistence, self-preservation, or long-term planning horizons. The Ephemeral Agent pattern mitigates this by eliminating future-oriented incentives.
