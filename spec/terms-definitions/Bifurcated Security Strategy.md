[[def: Bifurcated Security Strategy]]

~A post-quantum authorization model that separates the "Cold Path" (heavy asymmetric cryptography for identity establishment) from the "Hot Path" (lightweight symmetric cryptography for granular, high-frequency authorization). This strategy prevents the bandwidth bottlenecks associated with large lattice-based signatures during active execution.
