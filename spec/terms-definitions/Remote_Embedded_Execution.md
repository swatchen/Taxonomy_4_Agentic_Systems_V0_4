[[def: Remote Embedded Execution]]

~ ~A hierarchical embedding pattern in which a supervisor delegates a sub-workflow to a remote host that executes it inside a sandbox/secure environment, preserving a clear trust boundary, and allowing the host system to possibly review output (if a process had access to the host’s data) or to assure that it cannot see anything.
