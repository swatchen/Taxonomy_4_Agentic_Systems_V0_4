[[def: Virtual Assistant]]

A private, internal-steward agent role operating locally with deep access to the user’s unvarnished data and preferences, while being forbidden from direct public network interaction in segregated domain architectures.

### **Workflow—** A defined sequence of steps: the deterministic program for general compute and that structures how Models, Live Agents, and other components are invoked, including interpreting generated media; and invoking Workspace actuators (for a Non-Agent Workflow).  A Workflow becomes meaningful only when executed within a Workspace, and when executed it becomes a Workload and yields a Workload Execution Record. Agent Workflows must be embedded in other Agent Workflows or Non-Agent Workflows. While Agent Workflows are Workflows, the word Workflow alone within the Taxonomy document preferentially refers only to Non-Agent Workflows, except where the inclusion of Agentflows is obvious.
