[[def: Deterministic Component]]

~ A **Component** whose behavior is fully predictable: given the same inputs, it produces the same outputs. This includes deterministic code components (e.g., parsers/validators) and can include deterministic Workflows used as subroutines. Deterministic components are commonly used for interpretation, validation, evaluation, and action execution.
