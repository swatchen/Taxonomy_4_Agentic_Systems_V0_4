[[def: Boltzmann Brain]]

~ A physics thought-experiment re-used in T4AS to describe a single-use, task-scoped Live Agent instantiation under the Ephemeral Agent pattern. A Boltzmann Brain exists only long enough to perform a specific generative task and is deterministically terminated immediately afterward, holding no persistent identity, memory, or authority.
