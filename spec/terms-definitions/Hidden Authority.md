[[def: Hidden Authority]]

~ ~Authority that emerges implicitly when boundaries collapse—e.g., when an Agent (Live) can effectively act, retain state, or bypass deterministic interpretation—rather than being explicitly mediated by Workflows and Workspace actuators.

~ ### **High-Embeddedness Component—** A component whose behavior/risk depends strongly on embedding context (Role data/policies, Workspace actuators/access controls, parent Workflow prompts/interpretation), so it cannot be evaluated in isolation and often must be certified with its embedding assembly.
