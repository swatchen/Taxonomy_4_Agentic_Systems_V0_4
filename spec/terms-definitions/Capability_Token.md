[[def: Capability Token]]

~ A cryptographically protected, communicable token representing Object-Capability (OCAP) authority, fusing designation (which resource) and permission (which action). In T4AS, capability tokens are minted by the Workspace, held and exercised by Non-Agent Workflows, and never injected into or held by Live Agents.
