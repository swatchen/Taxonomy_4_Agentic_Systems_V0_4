[[def: Signaling]]

~A required, externally visible and cryptographically supported indicator of certain high-impact state changes (e.g., human-in-the-loop avatar possession) so others can distinguish human control from agent control.

**Signing Actuator—** A Workspace-provided actuator used to perform cryptographic signing with protected keys, invoked only after a Non-Agent Workflow parses an Agent’s or other signing request and checks it against policy; it produces “an auditable record.”
