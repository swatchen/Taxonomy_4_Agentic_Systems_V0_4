[[def: Deterministic Component—** A **Component** whose behavior is fully predictable: given the same inputs, it produces the same outputs. This includes deterministic code components (e.g., parsers/validators) and can include deterministic **Workflows** used as subroutines. Deterministic components are commonly used for interpretation, validation, evaluation, and action execution.

~ **Deterministic Interpretation—** The principle that **Non-Agent Workflows** implement the only legal interpretations of agent media, with logic that is deterministic, testable, and certifiable,” so the same inputs yield the same actions and third parties can verify that unsafe direct mappings (e.g., from strings to destructive calls) are impossible.

~ **Deterministic Workflow]]

~ ~A Workflow that “contain\[s\] no generative components” and is “fully predictable”: given the same inputs it always produces the same outputs; commonly used as interpreter/validator/evaluator/action-executor logic inside a Workspace.
