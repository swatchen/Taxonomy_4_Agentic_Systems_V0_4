[[def: Component]]

~A self-contained, reusable, and often certifiable part of a larger system, including deterministic code (parsers/validators/policy checkers), a specific Model, a simple Workflow, or even an **Agent Workflow** embedded as a callable Oracle inside other systems. Components may be independently certified, and certification can be dependent on the certification of sub-components.
