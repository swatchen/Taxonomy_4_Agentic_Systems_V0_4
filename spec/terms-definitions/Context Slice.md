[[def: Context Slice]]

The task-scoped subset of an Agent Role’s stored history/documents injected into a Loaded Agent for a specific objective, chosen to prevent Context Rot and reduce hallucination.

**Context Assembly—**The Role-centered function of selecting relevant history, memory, policies, and current task inputs (from an **Agent Role**) and injecting them to create a **Loaded Model** so a new **Live Agent** can begin generating output; it is also the mechanism used for **reinstantiation**.
