[[def: Cryptographic signing]]

~ An illustrative T4AS pattern where a Live Agent may only request a signature as generated media, a Non-Agent Workflow parses and policy-checks that request, and the Workspace performs the signature via a signing actuator using protected keys and produces an auditable record—placing trust in the Workspace \+ deterministic workflow, not the agent’s internal state.
