[[def: Ephemeral Agent]]

~ A recommended safety and performance pattern in which a Live Agent is never treated as a persistent process; instead it is instantiated as a transient Workload for a specific generative task (a “Boltzmann Brain”) and deterministically terminated immediately upon completion, with continuity maintained by the Agent Role (the persistent storehouse for history/goals/evolving context). This enforces “Structural Mortality.”
