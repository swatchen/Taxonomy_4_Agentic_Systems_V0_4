[[def: Certification]]

~ ~A formal verification regime that attests to properties of taxonomic artifacts (e.g., Workspaces, Workflows/Agentflows, Components) such that their behavior, boundaries, and provenance can be trusted in the appropriate scope, with scope depending on how context-dependent (embedded) the thing being certified is.
