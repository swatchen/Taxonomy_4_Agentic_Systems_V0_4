[[def: Certification]]

A formal verification regime that attests to properties of taxonomic artifacts (e.g., Workspaces, Workflows/Agentflows, Components) such that their behavior, boundaries, and provenance can be trusted in the appropriate scope, with scope depending on how context-dependent (embedded) the thing being certified is.

### **Certification Scope —**The notion that what can be certified “globally” vs “only in context” depends on embeddedness: low-embeddedness artifacts can often be certified once and reused; high-embeddedness artifacts often must be certified together with the Roles/Workflows/Workspaces embedding them.
