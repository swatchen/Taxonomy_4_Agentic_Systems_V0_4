[[def: Action History]]

A persistent, comprehensive log of a user’s actions in their computing environment, maintained within a Sovereign Personal Stack so that a Virtual Assistant (Agent Role) can derive context, preferences, and provenance for safe mediation of future actions.

 **Actuator** — A certified, state-changing capability exposed by a Workspace (e.g., tools, APIs, microservices, UI components) that can perform side effects. In T4AS, actuators are invoked by Non-Agent Workflows (after deterministic interpretation of generated media), never directly by an Agent (Live).
